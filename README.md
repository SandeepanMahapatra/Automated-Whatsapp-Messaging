# Whatsapp Messaging Code
 This was a fun project I made with the help of selenium library. I wanted to do something else and got this as a by-product. With this code, I can send any message  to any recipent  for n number of times (n taken in as input). A lot of cool and fun things can be done just by a little tweaking of the code. Feel free to use my code to do that. But I urge people to use this for educational purposes only.
 
Whatsapp Automation is a collection of APIs that interact with WhatsApp messenger running in Chrome Driver, allowing developers to build projects that automate sending and receiving messages.

The project uses Pyhton with Selenium.
 
 #### Note: This is just an experimental project which is not intended to voilate any Terms and Conditions of Whatsapp.
